90. Full transparent TCP proxy
Technologies: Linux, iptables/TPROXY, C99, libevent
Duration: 2 months

We have done R&D in a Linux transparent TCP proxy knowledge domain. https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/tproxy.txt

Some open source implementation of similar software was explored in detail, tested under heavy loads, and reasons of bad behavior were found. Different approaches of proxying TCP connections were tested (read/write, splice; edge triggered vs level). For implementation we selected libevent library which allows us to implement proxy with a very compact code. Implemented proxy supports spoofing sockets (IP_TRANSPARENT).
Using the feature of a modern Linux kernel we implemented a very simple, but effective multi-process model using  SO_REUSEPORT, which allows multiple instances of proxy to listen on the same IP/port; load balancing is done by kernel. The released server is able to support thousands of TCP sessions per process. Using Docker we implemented simple, but very important for consistence testing, test suite. It includes one-click creation of testing network environment including test client, transparent proxy and test backend ( HTTP or echo server).

Short: rewriting an existing proxy application.

106. Analyse customer behavior in CCTV stream
Technologies: Python, OpenCV, Deep Learning
Duration: 6 months

The goal of this project is making video analytics for the specialized intelligent systems of accounting and control of visitors, on the basis of which it is possible both to optimize the adoption of managerial decisions (for example, changing the schedule of a trading facility) and to study the effectiveness of marketing actions.

Within the framework of the current project, the following tasks were accomplished:
1) definition of characteristics of the general traffic of visitors: volume and time of entrance / exit of visitors on the territory of the trading hall;
2) determination of personal characteristics of visitors: maximum / minimum and average length of stay in the trading floor;
3) determination of the individual characteristics of visitors: the identification of regular customers (using unique features, for example, a person) and their preferences (client traffic maps through the trading floor area).

Technical details. The hardware basis of the project is two video cameras installed inside the store, the view angle of which allows you to monitor the input / output zones, and the resolution is sufficient for personal identification (Full HD, or higher); a server equipped with a GeForce GTX 1080 (or higher) graphics card and 8 GB of RAM (or more), the performance of which allows to process the video stream in real time (or close to it).

Algorithmic details.
1) The video stream of the camera is divided into a sequence of frames processed at a given sampling frequency (for example, frame_step = 3).

2) The current frame is fed to the detector input (neural network based on the ResNet-50 model), which returns the coordinates of the minimum enveloping rectangle, the global CNN-sign (length 256), and also the confidence of each visitor's detection.

3) For rectangles with confidence of the detector above a given threshold, local characteristics calculated by a specialized neural network (also based on the ResNet-50 model) are calculated, taking into account the local characteristics of the visitor by dividing the image into 6 horizontal bands; Local characteristics are combined with a global one.

4) Tracking the visitors by assigning the detected rectangles to one of the existing track lists or initializing a new track list (taking into account the normalized L2 distance of the CNN-signs, the intersection area of ​​the rectangles, as well as the motion path estimated by the Kalman filter).

5) Using the given map of the entrance / exit zones on the territory of the trading floor, the track lists are referred to as input / output, with input data placed in the queue, and output is compared with track lists from the queue in order to identify the visitor.

6) All information about visitors generated during processing is stored in the specified formats (.mp4, .csv, .txt); the values ​​of the main parameters, the input and output paths can be configured using the console user interface.

исходя из опыта работы с аналогичными задачами можно выделить следующие ключевые моменты, которые необходимо выяснить:
1. определение номера происходить в процессе движения? если да, то необходим понимать характеристики (fps и фокусное расстояние камеры, средние углы установки, фронатльно к потоку, под углом и на какой высоте)
в этом случае задача также включает применения алгоритмов deconvolution с явным или случайным ядром (зависит от свойств видеооборудования)
2. идентификация номера происходит в определенном месте кадра (нампример некоторая отсечка на полосе движения или стоп линия перед пунктом пропуска) или потенциально автомобиль может находиться практически в любой точке кадра? во втором случае необходимо также предусмотреть алгорит поиска автомобиля на изображении с последующей идентификацией места установки номерного знака, в противном случае будет достаточно много срабатываний на разные буквенно намерные надписи, например на бортах грузовых автомобилей.
3. необходимо детально понимать особенности местного законодательства и стандартизации шаблонов номерных знаков. Достаточно часто, местное законодательство допускает размещение графических элементов непосредственно на номерном знаке (не только буквенно-цифровые обозначения). Что является существенным моментом и существенно влияет на качество идентификации и распознавания.
Как таковая задача распознавания символов в идентифицированном шабло уже достаточно хорошо решена, как с использованием упомянутой библиотеки так и конкурирующих решения на CNN-rCNN (глубокие нейронные сети)
